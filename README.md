# JHS-ObstacleRacer-Assignment
Intro to Communications Course

In this project, you will develop your knowledge of programming with ROBOTC for Vex (available to download [here](https://www.vexrobotics.com/robotc-vexedr-vexiq.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiA9dDwBRC9ARIsABbedBMDU-1o7Ihp4-JlVKe5vP7qzQuGAG0UaOeJ6IqcN99QavRiZN2nhEIaAhq2EALw_wcB)) to create a robot that can maneuver around and manipulate an obstacle course. Passing the project means completing all design deliverables set by the racing committee below.

## Design Brief

The racing committee has developed a contained obstacle course for competitive use. Your team must design and build an Obstacle Racer that can maneuver around a track and manipulate obstacles out of the way of your path. The racer must be programmed before the race begins and not interfere with another race team's efforts. The prototype must include at least three motors for track movement and obstacle manipulation and two bumper switches at the front and the back for sensing purposes. Good Luck!

## Further Project Requirements

1. The design and prototype implementation must be completed using VEX components and the ROBOTC programming software.
2. Comments in the code should communicate each function's intended purpose clearly.
3. The final write up is professional with descriptive pictures of your racer build and program.
4. A final video is provided (which can easily be linked through the use of a markdown (.md) file).
   - The [writeup_template.md](https://github.com/joshrwhite/JHS-ObstacleRacer-Assignment/blob/master/writeup_template.md) file in the repository, can be used to fulfill requirements 3 & 4.
5. The final submission will be a link to your GitHub repository for this project, so please maintain a professional digital environment.
6. While successful completion of the project means that the design constraints found in the Design Brief are met, A+ work will be awarded to projects that show creativity in meeting these objectives.

## Repository Navigation

Aside from the `README.md` file and supporting documents, there is an `.c` file for example code for obstacle movement. The example ROBOTC program shows the basic branch and variable functions of a closed-loop system. These can be mimicked, but blatant plagiarism will be penalized.

There is also a `writeup_template.md` file which can be used as a starting point for the final report.

## Downloading ROBOPro

After going to the download [URL](https://www.vexrobotics.com/robotc-vexedr-vexiq.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiA9dDwBRC9ARIsABbedBMDU-1o7Ihp4-JlVKe5vP7qzQuGAG0UaOeJ6IqcN99QavRiZN2nhEIaAhq2EALw_wcB), you can enter Setup with either an .EXE or .MSI file downloaded. Make sure to install all drivers so that the USB is able to be read by the computer.
